Arcade Game

Fourth project of Google Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Scholarship at Udacity.

How to Play

The player has to cross the stone blocks and get to the water. The enemies(bugs) cannot be touched because the player will be moved back to the start. If the player achives the goal the alert will appears and the "OK" must be clicked to start all over again. 
Use the arrow keys to move the player (up, down, right, left).

Description

The game was based on the Udacity starter code https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game. I had to change the app.js file to make the game works and I have done it with Javascript ES6.
